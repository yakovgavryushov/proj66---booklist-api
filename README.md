# Book list API

To use this API you need to

1. download or clone the repo;
2. open a terminal;
3. get to the folder location in terminal;
4. call "npm init" in terminal;
5. then call "npm run start" in terminal'
6. and then go to the page "localhost:4000" in any of your browsers;

NOTE: the number 4000 is a port address and it is set in index.js file at a line 1 and you can change it if your port 4000 is already busy.

NOTE: The only source of books now it russian e-bookstore "labirint.ru", but later others can be added, if it will possible

also: to add all the genres to the list -- you should click every genre just once and it will be added (in future something better will be implemented)
