# Book list API

To use this API you need to

1. download or clone the repo;
2. open a terminal;
3. get to the file location in terminal;
4. call "npm init" in terminal;
5. then call "npm run start" in terminal'
6. and then go to the page "localhost:4000" in any of your browsers;

NOTE: the number 4000 is a port address and it is set in index.js file at a line 1 and you can change it if your port 4000 is already busy.

NOTE: Now its only the button "all books" that works, other buttons are in process of development
